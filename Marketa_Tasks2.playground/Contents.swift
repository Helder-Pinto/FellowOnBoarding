/*1 -  write a function called same which accepts two arrays and returns TRUE if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The Frequency of Values must be the same.
                Outcome:  same([1,2,3], [4,1,9])  returns true
                          same([1,2,3], [1,9])  return false
 */







/*
2 - Write function that takes two string and return true if the second is an anagram of the first.
    Anagram is word phrase or sequence formed by the same letters/symbols/numbers from another.
    example: Dormitory = Dirty room.
             School master = The classroom
             Listen = Silent
             Astronomer = Moon starer
             The eyes = They see

     Outcome: validAnagram('', '')  returns true
              validAnagram('Listen', 'Silent') returns true
              validAnagram('bar', 'car') returns false

 */





/* 3 - Write a function that takes a sorted array on Integers and returns how many unique values are in the array.

    Outcome: uniqueValues([2,2,2,2,3,3,5,6]) returns 4
             uniqueValues([1,1,2,2]) returns 2
 */





/* 4 - Write a function which accepts an array of integers and a second argument called num of type Int, and returns the maximum sum of  num consecutive elements in the array.

        Outcome: subSum([1,2,3,4], 2)    returns 7     because 3+4
                 subSum([10,2,3,5,20,3], 3)       returns 28      because 5+20+3
